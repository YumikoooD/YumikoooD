## About Me

I'm an AI Builder focused on **User Experience**.

I build products from scratch – from idea → prototype → production – combining:
- **AI engineering** (AI Agents, STT/LLM/TTS pipelines...)
- **full-stack development** (Python, React, Next.js, Golang...)
- **product thinking & UX**

My goal: create natural, human-like AI experiences that solve real problems.

## Currently

- Studying at **Epitech Technology** (MSc CS, 2022–2027)  
- Working on real-time AI systems & voice-driven experiences
