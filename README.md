## About Me

I'm an AI Product Engineer focused on **real-time voice interfaces**, **LLM-powered agents**, and **fast end-to-end product building**.

I build products from scratch – from idea → prototype → production – combining:
- **AI engineering** (STT/LLM/TTS pipelines)
- **full-stack development** (Python, React, Next.js)
- **product thinking & UX**

My goal: create natural, human-like AI experiences that solve real problems.
